Hereâ€™s an example of a gas alert system using C++ on Arduino. This system uses an MQ-2 gas sensor to detect gases like LPG, propane, methane, and others. When gas is detected above a certain threshold, it triggers a buzzer and LED to alert.

Components Required:
Arduino board (e.g., Uno)
MQ-2 gas sensor
Buzzer
LED
Resistor (220 ohms for the LED)
Jumper wires
Breadboard
Circuit Diagram:
Connect the MQ-2 sensor:
VCC to 5V
GND to GND
A0 to A0 pin of Arduino
Connect the LED with a resistor to a digital pin (e.g., pin 9)
Connect the buzzer to another digital pin (e.g., pin 10)
